## No SoD Sounds Mod for SoD and EET

This mods lets vanilla NPCs keep their original BG1 sound sets during SoD.  
Note: This works ONLY when transitioning from BG1 to SoD (not for new SoD games) and ONLY for the following vanilla NPCs:  
(Jaheira already uses her original voice set by default)  

- Dynaheir
- Edwin
- Khalid
- Minsc
- Safan
- Viconia

I didn't include Beamdog's own NPCs as I don't think it makes much sense.
